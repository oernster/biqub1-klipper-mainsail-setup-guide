ssh into your pi
Then run these commands:
sudo apt-get install build-essential libjpeg8-dev imagemagick libv4l-dev cmake git -y
mkdir ~/mjpg-streamer
cd ~/mjpg-streamer
git clone https://github.com/jacksonliam/mjpg-streamer.git
cd mjpg-streamer/mjpg-streamer-experimental
make
sudo make install
use raspi-config to enable cameras on your pi
Go into klipper_config and update yoru webcam.txt according to the comments in the file.
reboot
You should now, if you've plugged in your camera (I use a Logitech C920), be able to see 
your stream in mainsail, though you may need to refresh the webpage.
